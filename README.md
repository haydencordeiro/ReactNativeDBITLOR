## Overview

### DbitLor - An Automated System For LOR process automation

### Aim
To develop the LOR Process Automation System to simplify the process of getting a Letter of Recommendation from any 
faculty in the college.
### Problem Analysis <a id="pa"></a>
To simplify the process of applying, drafting, approving and printing a LOR. Current scenario is that the student has to 
talk to the faculty if he/she would give a LOR, then the student and the faculty coordinate and draft a LOR, which is then 
approved. Once approved, the student has to submit a letter of request to the administration department of the 
institute to get the institute letterhead. Later, the student prints the drafted LOR on the letterhead and it is signed by 
the faculty
This process has a lot of delays, involves repeated visits to the institute, and various other challenges that increase the 
difficulty to get a LOR. Therefore, by taking the process online, it would become an advantage to the faculty, the 
students as well as the college administration.
### Objective
Make an online based system where the student can ask a faculty in the college to give them a LOR. The system then 
allows the teacher to accept or reject the proposal. Once the teacher accepts the request, it allows the student and 
teacher to work on a draft of the LOR. Once, the draft is submitted by the student, the faculty can make changes in the 
draft, and once the draft is final, the faculty can approve the draft. When the draft is approved, the system would 
embed the draft into the letterhead of the institute and also has the option to embed the digital signature of the faculty 
and the final LOR can be downloaded by the student.
